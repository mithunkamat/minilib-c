FUNCTION
<<fputs>>---write a character string in a file or stream

INDEX
	fputs
INDEX
	_fputs_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fputs(const char *<[s]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

	#include <stdio.h>
	int _fputs_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, const char *<[s]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fputs(<[s]>, <[fp]>)
	char *<[s]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

	#include <stdio.h>
	int _fputs_r(<[ptr]>, <[s]>, <[fp]>)
	struct _reent *<[ptr]>;
	char *<[s]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

DESCRIPTION
<<fputs>> writes the string at <[s]> (but without the trailing null)
to the file or stream identified by <[fp]>.

<<_fputs_r>> is simply the reentrant version of <<fputs>> that takes
an additional reentrant struct pointer argument: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
If successful, the result is <<0>>; otherwise, the result is <<EOF>>.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fputs>>, but does not specify that the result on
success must be <<0>>; any non-negative value is permitted.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.
