FUNCTION
<<fgets>>---get character string from a file or stream

INDEX
	fgets
INDEX
	_fgets_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
        #include <stdio.h>
	char *fgets(char *<[buf]>, int <[n]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

        #include <stdio.h>
	char *_fgets_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, char *<[buf]>, int <[n]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	char *fgets(<[buf]>,<[n]>,<[fp]>)
        char *<[buf]>;
	int <[n]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

	#include <stdio.h>
	char *_fgets_r(<[ptr]>, <[buf]>,<[n]>,<[fp]>)
	struct _reent *<[ptr]>;
        char *<[buf]>;
	int <[n]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

DESCRIPTION
	Reads at most <[n-1]> characters from <[fp]> until a newline
	is found. The characters including to the newline are stored
	in <[buf]>. The buffer is terminated with a 0.

	The <<_fgets_r>> function is simply the reentrant version of
	<<fgets>> and is passed an additional reentrancy structure
	pointer: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
	<<fgets>> returns the buffer passed to it, with the data
	filled in. If end of file occurs with some data already
	accumulated, the data is returned with no other indication. If
	no data are read, NULL is returned instead.

PORTABILITY
	<<fgets>> should replace all uses of <<gets>>. Note however
	that <<fgets>> returns all of the data, while <<gets>> removes
	the trailing newline (with no indication that it has done so.)

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.
